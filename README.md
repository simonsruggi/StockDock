## Install

### Build from source

Requires **Xcode 15+** and **macOS 14 Sonoma** or later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonsruggi/StockDock.git
cd StockDock
swift build -c release
```

The binary will be at `.build/release/StockDock`.

To create an app bundle and install:

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme StockDock -configuration Release -destination 'platform=macOS' -derivedDataPath .build/xcode build
cp .build/xcode/Build/Products/Release/StockDock /Applications/StockDock.app/Contents/MacOS/StockDock
```

### Run

Double-click `StockDock.app` or:

```bash
open /Applications/StockDock.app
```

The app runs in the menu bar — look for the chart icon (or your chosen display) in the top-right of your screen. Click it to open the popover.

## Usage

### Watchlist

Add stocks by clicking **Add stock** at the bottom of the Watchlist tab. Search by symbol, company name, or ISIN (e.g. `AAPL`, `Tesla`, `IE00B4L5Y983`). Search results show live price and currency. Stocks show:

- Current price with currency symbol
- Daily change (absolute and percentage)
- Extended hours price when available (PRE/POST badge)

Right-click a stock to remove it.

### Portfolios

1. Click the **Portfolios** tab
2. Click **New portfolio** to create one
3. Click **Add holding** to add a stock with quantity and average price

Each portfolio shows:
- **Total value** in your chosen currency
- **P&L** (profit & loss) in absolute and percentage terms
- Per-holding breakdown with price, value, and individual P&L

Right-click a holding to edit or delete it.

### Settings

Click the gear icon tab to configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Stock Price Currency** | Convert all displayed prices to a single currency, or keep original |
| **Portfolio Currency** | Base currency for portfolio totals and P&L (EUR, USD, GBP, CHF, JPY, CAD, AUD) |
| **Show Extended Hours** | Toggle pre-market and after-hours prices on/off — affects prices, P&L, and menu bar |
| **Menu Bar Display** | What appears in your menu bar (see below) |

### Menu Bar Display Options

| Option | Example |
|---|---|
| P&L | `P&L +321.09€` |
| P&L % | `P&L +2.3%` |
| P&L + % | `+321.09€ (+2.3%)` |
| Total Value | `14396.67€` |
| Best Stock | `AAPL +1.2%` |
| Worst Stock | `TSLA -0.8%` |
| Best & Worst | `▲AAPL +1.2%  ▼TSLA -0.8%` |
| Icon Only | Chart icon |

Best/Worst are based on daily change % from your watchlist.
